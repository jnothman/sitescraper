    In 2006-07, 1632 were stolen.

    "If people didn't leave valuables in their cars it would reduce the opportunities for thieves to steal," he said.

    It could lead to an upbeat spring auction season, with buyers more willing to purchase a home if they believe the current cycle of tighter interest rates is over.
    
    Figures collected from across the metropolitan area showed clearance rates for weekend auctions rose strongly to 66%, up from 60% last weekend.
    
    It was the biggest gain in week-on-week growth for a non-holiday auction period in a year, although the clearance rate is still well below rates close to 85% reached last year.
    
    The highest weekend clearance rate was recorded for house auctions in the north-east (88%), and sales activity in the inner city was also strong, according to the Real Estate Institute of Victoria.
    
    "Buyers reacted positively to speculation about a drop in interest rates by the Reserve Bank, leading to an improvement in the clearance rate," REIV chief executive Enzo Raimondo said.
    
    Agents working at the weekend at auctions and open-for-inspections reported there was more interest from buyers. However, they said home buyers would need to see a number of rate cuts before they rushed back into the market.
    
    Peter Bennison, a director at JP Dixon Real Estate, said bidding was not fierce at the auctions he attended in the inner east, but properties were selling rather than being passed in.
    
    "People are starting to think about property again," Mr Bennison said. "They may not be out there bidding strongly yet, but they are starting to think this is the end."
    
    Craig Stephens, director of sales at Jas H Stephens, said: "Buyers and sellers still seem to be sitting on the fence a bit. It seems to be a given that the RBA will reduce rates next month, but the big question on everyone's lips is 'will the banks pass on the full rate cut?'
    
    "There is a lot of stock about to hit the market in September and October and this rate cut would certainly be very pleasing and greeted warmly by people … it will be the spark that we need for the rest of the year."

    The drug's potential is so great it could mark an end to dialysis for patients with kidney disease and reduce the need for organ transplants.
    
    Scientists from the University of Melbourne, St Vincent's Hospital and Bio21 Institute say the breakthrough could rival Ian Frazer's cervical cancer vaccine in putting Australia on the world map of medical discoveries.
    
    The drug works by preventing the spread of fibrosis - the irreversible scarring of vital organs that underpins many major killers such as kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes and lung and liver problems. As fibrosis advances, it causes such extensive damage that the organ shuts down, eventually resulting in death.
    
    There is no available treatment that prevents or halts the spread of the condition and scientists internationally are racing to be the first to produce an antifibrotic drug.
    
    The Melbourne discovery, named FT-11, has created such international excitement that the US Government has pledged up to $3 million to accelerate the drug to market - the first time such a grant has been awarded in Australia.
    
    The Melbourne project has had a 100% success rate in trials on rats and will be trialled on about 30 Victorian patients within months.
    
    The compound not only produces dramatic improvements but displays no side effects.
    
    Scientists estimate the drug's worldwide market would be worth up to $2 billion in the first year alone. It would also be a financial coup worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Melbourne University because it shares patent rights for the drug through Fibrotech Therapeutics.
    
    Associate Professor Darren Kelly, who led the two-year quest to develop the drug, said: "This is the first drug of its kind in the world and the implications are enormous. If this comes to fruition, and we're confident with the results so far … it would be up there with the cervical cancer vaccine (Gardasil), even bigger. It would be the biggest blockbuster since blood- pressure-lowering drugs." """]),

    The research shows that Victorians' support for legal late-term abortions after 24 weeks' gestation is much wider than reflected in a proposed law expected to go to state cabinet today.
    
    The Age believes the Government has settled on the Victorian Law Reform Commission's Option B, which makes abortion before 24 weeks the choice of the mother, but strictly prescribes when an abortion can be provided after that date.
    
    But a Victorian obstetrician, associate professor Lachlan de Crespigny of the University of Melbourne, commissioned a survey that suggests the average Victorian favours a less restrictive law. The online survey of 1050 Australians (including 526 Victorians), by Crosby/Textor, evaluated support for legal abortion after the 24-week cut-off. This was strongest for legal late abortions when continuing the pregnancy would put the life of the mother at risk, or when the baby had severe abnormalities that would lead to a short life.
    
    There was also majority support for decriminalising late abortions when: the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest, the baby might be physically or mentally impaired, the mother had a major drug addiction, or she was aged 15 or under.
    
    One-third of Victorians believed a late abortion should be allowed when the woman for any reason decided she did not wish to have the child, the woman or family could not afford to raise the child, or if the woman's partner died or left her during pregnancy.
    
    There were no circumstances in which a majority of Victorians, or Australians, believed a doctor should face sanctions for performing a termination after 24 weeks.
    
    The survey found no significant difference in opinion between men and women, or between Victoria and the rest of Australia. Those with stated religious affiliations were slightly less in favour of legalising late-term abortion, while people aged over 45 were more in favour."""]),

Expenses for the trips, which each required at least one night's accommodation, totalled more than $17,500.

Five visits to Mount Hotham involved expenses totalling more than $8500.

The final item on the itinerary for the opening of the Alpine Visitor Centre at Lake Mountain in July 2004 says: "2pm — minister departs/goes skiing".
    
    The FoI documents show Mr Thwaites stayed at Northey Lodge at Tidal River for a total of 44 nights, at no charge.
    
    The Opposition says Northey Lodge normally costs nearly $200 a night, so the free accommodation for the minister was valued at more than $8000.
    
    The documents show that, on the first parliamentary sitting day after The Age revealed Mr Thwaites' receipt of free luxury ski accommodation at Falls Creek, his department prepared a suggested answer for the minister to questions about the purpose of such visits.
    
    The briefing note suggests he point out that his responsibilities as minister in charge of the management of the resorts include "promotion of Victoria's alpine tourism industry".
    
    The documents show the visits were for official functions such as the opening of ski seasons, presentations to ski teams and inspections of facilities.

    Purana detectives have seized more than $50 million in assets they allege Mokbel and associates had acquired through criminal activity. But in many of the cases the assets, including more than 60 houses and 30 cars, were held in the names of other people. This resulted in a series of cases in which the seizure orders were listed to be contested in the County Court by those who claimed they, not Mokbel, were the true owners.
    
    However, such cases tend to be heard in open court. This means respected businessmen, racing identities and the occasional bookmaker would have to appear and explain their relationship with Mokbel, a man now facing a string of drug-trafficking charges and two murder cases.
    
    In about eight cases those who loudly declared they would fight the confiscation orders have decided to settle quietly.
    
    In one case, a man who has been on Centrelink payments for years would have had to explain how he managed to pay off a property he could not possibly afford.
    
    As late as last week a man well known in racing circles decided it was better to pay up and shut up than head to the County Court for four days to argue that he was the owner of a property the Crown claims was Mokbel's. His lawyers agreed that their client was prepared to make a substantial cash payment to the Crown to square the ledger over a Mokbel property listed in the man's name.
    
    Although the settlement will remain confidential, it is believed the prominent client was left with only sufficient change from $800,000 to catch a taxi home.
    
    Police say up to 30 people have been used to front companies and use properties that were once part of the Mokbel empire.
    
    A report into racing by former County Court judge Gordon Lewis, released by the State Government during the Olympics in the hope it would be swamped by medal fever, has revealed police concerns over bookmakers' "commercial dealings with criminal identities (and) assisting criminal identities in concealing assets from police".
    
    Mokbel once bragged to police that he made more money through the punt than through the other alleged lucrative arm of his business ventures. But once given the inside running by some in the racing industry, he is now on his own. Jockeys who once gave him tips have jumped off him quicker than a stumbling steeplechaser.

    Trevor Taylor, 61, obtained the figure on the first day of mediations in Melbourne for 13 claims made over the 1964 crash.
    
    The accident, involving the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne and the destroyer HMAS Voyager on February 10, 1964, has been described as Australia's worst peacetime navy disaster.

    "You were never really told what to expect...you see, they gave all the advice and counselling to the survivors of the Voyager, which is fair enough, but they didn't realise that there could be people on the Melbourne who needed some help, too," he said.
    
    "It's a lot like a crash between a semi-trailer and a Mini Minor. They forget about the driver of the semi-trailer...the driver of the Mini Minor might be dead, but it doesn't mean to say there hasn't been some sort of damage or effect done to the driver of the semi-trailer. That's exactly the (sort of) situation that we ended up in."
    
    According to his claim in the Supreme Court, Mr Taylor was on board HMAS Melbourne when the ships collided off the coast near Jervis Bay, in New South Wales.
    
    It is alleged he was numb and in shock after helping Voyager survivors - some covered in oil - from boats sent to rescue them.
    
    Mr Taylor, who now lives in Adelaide, spent another 11 years in the navy after the accident, then worked in various jobs before being granted a disability pension.
    
    He has claimed damages for conditions including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, brain damage and stress conditions resulting in alcohol and cigarette addiction.
    
    Today, he said he wanted to take a holiday to Darwin, which he had not visited since before Cyclone Tracy struck in 1974. He also hoped to perform some charity work.

"""Hello.

I'm trying to make pressure control work in gimp-2.4.7 on G-Pen 450 graphic tablet, on slackware 12.1.

Problem:
1) If in Edit->preferences->Input Devices->configure advanced input devices, tablet device mode is set to "disabled", pressure control doesn't work and I can draw only lines with constant thickness/opacity/etc. (as with mouse)
2) If in Edit->preferences->Input Devices->configure advanced input devices, tablet device mode is set to "Screen" or "Window", pressure control doesn't work, because when I press pen, pen cursor stops moving (i.e. freezes) until I stop pressing it. I.e. I can place "dots" by pen, but can't draw lines.

Additional info:
1) Pressure controls work fine in inkscape (version 0.46) or krita (from KDE 3.5.7). Krita detects presure automatically (because device is named as "stylus"), inkscape can use it, when in file->input devices device mode is set to "screen" or "window". However when I'm trying to use similar settings for tablet in gimp, cursor simply freezes when I try to draw something.
2) gimp 2.4.7 is built from source. In the gimp-2.4.5 (bundled with slackware 12.1) pressure controls didn't work either.
3) I'm using wizardpen 0.6.0.2 driver.
4) I've been using this and this HOWTOs to setup tablet. Unfortunately, HOWTOs has gimp-related content removed, and FAQ on gimp site doesn't seem to mention anything related to my problem.
5) Xorg.conf sections related to tablet(not sure if it's relevant to problem, because pressure control work in krita/inkscape):
Code:

I'm running openSuse 10.2 on my laptop and i'm trying to install iTunes with wine and it gives me and error saying: This iTunes installer requires that your computer is running Windows XP or Vista.

All other windows apps work with wine. I read on some forum that iTunes does not work with wine in Suse 10.2? Has anyone worked around this problem if that's the case?

Though I consider iTunes trash software, simply because it has never worked without problems on me The other available software works perfectly with the iPod I own, and that's enough (software like Amarok, GTKpod or one of the Windows things like Winamp plugin).

EDIT: whenever Wine is in question, don't expect anything to run on it. There is no guarantee, and from personal experience I can tell that if a program does run on one Wine version, it might not run on another -- even if the "another" version was newer. Some apps run perfectly fine, others don't run at all, and some may crash at unexpected places. If you really need the Windows programs, buy a legal copy of Windows (XP is good) and either install it as a virtual operating system or just get it some hardware of it's own, preferrably new enough for it to run fast enough for your nerves.""",
