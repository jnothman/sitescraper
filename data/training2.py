The answer would ideally highlight the most common roles that exist in software development teams as well as provide a definition that allows people to recognise their role and see what they would need to work on to progress with their chosen career path.

""",
"""
I would break down the question by skill Sets.

    *

          Program Manager. This is the person with oversight to the program. What are the analysts, architects, and developers doing. A really good program manager takes care of all of the excess, so that the computer people can do their computer things. The good program managers that I work with spend a lot of time taking care of all of those tedious emails and phone calls so that developers don't have to worry about that interference.
              *

                    Business Analyst. This person is a hybrid, someone who has a fundamental understanding of programming (doesn't have to be an expert) and can really understand people and their problems. Has the ability to translate a real-world problem into a programmable solution. This can be one of the most difficult skills to find, since you need someone who can (a) talk to the customer in their language without (b) becoming a salesman. A good business analyst can solve problems by determining the workflow of an application, understands edge cases, and can design a functional requirements document that software architects will understand.
                        *

                              Software Architect. This person designs the program, specifically the library and class diagram requirements. What does the program actually do? In interface-based programming, this is the person designing the public interfaces that objects expose. The design of the class libraries from the software architect may not be method/property complete (some methods may be missing) but it should be functionally complete.
                                  *

                                        Developer/Programmer. Fills in the gaps left by the software architect. If the architect is the framer, then it is the developer who adds the wiring, plumbing, and drywall. A developer is not necessarily lower level. Just because an architect says, "We need a method to perform function 'X'", it does necessarily mean that performing function 'X' is easy.
                                            *

                                                  Most business programs will be about data, and if yours involves a server, then you'll want a database architect. The DBA does more that just create the table. A good DBA knows all of the little intricacies (like the differences between clustered or nonclustered indexes, and such minutiae) that make a program go from working to working fast.

                                                  Software design is not always top-to-bottom. At the interviews I been in, the paths seems to be very linear. Developer, then architect, then analyst, then program manager. But I really like being an architect. Even though the Analysts get paid more (and the Program Managers get paid more still), I don't think that I would like those positions. At my company, they aren't coders any longer. Analysts do participate in GUI/Web design, though, since that can have a direct effect on the the workflow and business requirements. But they don't write the "guts".

                                                  Hope this helps.

""",
"""
Let's first define software development as going through the life cycle of requirements gathering, design and analysis, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance so here is an elaboration on each:

Requirements gathering - This is where the "what" part of the software is determined as in finding out what is needed. Usually this involves talking to non-technical people and converting their requests into technical documentation known as a specification or spec. Business analysts are usually the role that handles this aspect of a project.

Design and analysis - This is where a plan is put forth as to what to do. Architects, business analysts and developers can all be involved here as this is where that specification is refined enough to be put into actual software.

Implementation - This is where the developers write the code to produce the requested software.

Testing - This is where what was done is verified to see that it was in fact done.

Deployment and maintenance - This is where the software is pushed out into the wild in a sense. Systems administrators are typically responsible for keeping an eye on the servers in the case of a web roll out though in other cases there may be techincal support people that get to see the software to handle any incoming calls.

Those are the major parts as I know them with a project manager to keep an eye on the project, a team lead which is usually one of the developers to be the person that any technical squabble can be resolved such as developers putting the finger at each other when there is a bug when their code is integrated, and sometimes someone from the business that is requesting the work may also play a role.

Junior/Intermediate/Senior - These will vary considerably as a Senior .Net developer may not have decades of experience that a COBOL or assembler programmer may have.

Architects are sometimes used though at my last job there wasn't such a position, just developers that took requirements from the CTO or CEO and wrote the software and had a tester who also deployed it.

Another point is to be aware of different methodologies that exist in software development like the traditional Waterfall where things are done one stage at a time and in order with no backtracking over several months, that is what is requested initially is what gets done without any changes or updated, compared to Agile where the requirements may change weekly and this is accomodated.

Application / Systems / Web - these are usually nearly the same thing these days as my last title was Senior Application Developer and the company was an Application Service Provider though more typically I say that I am a Web Developer. Systems tends to refer to working with an Operating System or something close to the O/S like configuring IIS or MS-SQL Servers for performance.

Administrators are those that run things and this could be networks, systems or databases. If you have other jargon in mind I think that should be viewed as a separate question as this answer is pretty long already I think.

    ('file:html/forum/stackoverflow/2.html', ["Can I get more than 1000 records from a DirectorySearcher in Asp.Net?",
"""

I just noticed that the return list for results is limited to 1000. I have more than 1000 groups in my domain (HUGE domain). How can I get more than 1000 records? Can I start at a later record? Can I cut it up into multiple searches?

Here is my query:

DirectoryEntry dirEnt = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://dhuba1kwtn004");
string[] loadProps = new string[] { "cn", "samaccountname", "name", "distinguishedname" };
DirectorySearcher srch = new DirectorySearcher(dirEnt, "(objectClass=Group)", loadProps);
var results = srch.FindAll();

I have tried to set srch.SizeLimit = 2000; but that doesn't seem to work. Any ideas?

""",
"""You need to set DirectorySearcher.PageSize to a non-zero value to get all results.

BTW you should also dispose DirectorySearcher when you're finished with it

using(DirectorySearcher srch = new DirectorySearcher(dirEnt, "(objectClass=Group)", loadProps))
{
    srch.PageSize = 1000;
        var results = srch.FindAll();
        }

        The API documentation isn't very clear, but essentially:

            *

                  when you do a paged search, the SizeLimit is ignored, and all matching results are returned as you iterate through the results returned by FindAll. Results will be retrieved from the server a page at a time. I chose the value of 1000 above, but you can use a smaller value if preferred. The tradeoff is: using a small PageSize will return each page of results faster, but will require more frequent calls to the server when iterating over a large number of results.
                      *

                            by default the search isn't paged (PageSize = 0). In this case up to SizeLimit results is returned.

                            As Biri pointed out, it's important to dispose the SearchResultCollection returned by FindAll, otherwise you may have a memory leak as described in the Remarks section of the MSDN documentation for DirectorySearcher.FindAll: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.directoryservices.directorysearcher.findall.aspx

                            One way to help avoid this in .NET 2.0 or later is to write a wrapper method that automatically disposes the SearchResultCollection. This might look something like the following (or could be an extension method in .NET 3.5):

                            public IEnumerable<SearchResult> SafeFindAll(DirectorySearcher searcher)
                            {
                                using(SearchResultCollection results = searcher.FindAll())
                                    {
                                            foreach (SearchResult result in searchResults)
                                                    {
                                                                yield return result;

                                                                            }

Given the multiple back end repositories of data, I can't easily rely on independent replication solutions for each one to maintain a consistent state.

Hola, amigos. I know it's been a long time since I rapped at ya, but things have been getting plenty hairy around here. First, I been running like a chicken with its head cut off trying to find some new tires for my Festiva. I know, a tire is a tire, but these are some weird-ass size that no one makes anymore. I caught a flat on one and I've been driving on my spare for about a month now. It don't worry me none, but if I get another flat, I'm screwed.

On top of that, I had my hours cut at the electronics store. My manager told me it was because of the economic downturn that people weren't buying anything. I told him that without a full-time check, I wasn't going to be buying anything either, so how did this help? That stumped him but good.

In order to live the lifestyle I'm accustomed to, I had to find me another part-time job. I went around to the pizza joints, because they always need delivery guys, but they were all hung up on having proof of insurance. I told them I had insurance, but I was just a couple months late on payments, but they weren't hearing it. Man, when did everyone start getting so tight-assed?

The thing that's really been chafing me is how hot it is. They say it ain't the heat, it's the humidity, but I really don't give a shit which it is. Either way, after being outside a while, my undies are stuck to my ass, and I got pit stains that meet at my chest. Last year, I pulled an air conditioner off my neighbor's curb and put that in my window. It did the trick. Wound up costing me a boatload when I got my electrical bill, but it was worth it. This year, it wouldn't turn on, so I dragged it back over to my neighbor's.

During the day, it wasn't so bad, because I was at work and they keep the electronics store a chilly 72 degrees. At quittin' time, I would go to the discount movie theater. But after seeing the cartoon where the chimps go to space for the fourth time, I couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't just the movie, but all the families with kids in there were looking at me like I had a turd growing on my head.

Really, I don't mind it being hot when I'm just sitting in my apartment chilling out and watching some TV, but it's a real bitch to get to sleep. I've tried everything. I put some cardboard down so I could sleep on my floor, but it smelled like moldy pizza crust and socks. I got an old box fan from Ron and plugged that in, but it rattled all night and barely cooled me down. Then I tried sleeping with a six-pack of ice-cold Miller Genuine Draft in my bed, but I wound up drinking it all. I guess that sort of worked anyway.

Finally, after my fourth night of not sleeping, I came up with a plan. I figured that since they had to keep the store cool even at night, I should just sleep in there. Why not? I could just kick back in a video game chair and finally get some decent shut-eye.

The only thing was, I had to find some way to stay in the store until after they locked up. I was only supposed to work until 6:00, and since I usually leave around 5:30, it would look weird for me to be hanging around for an extra four and a half hours until they closed. I asked all around to see if I could pick up someone else's shift, you know, kill two birds with one stone and make a little extra money. I almost had this guy Wayne on the hook, but he was taking off the next weekend and he needed all the hours he could get. What a dick.

Since I wasn't going to be able to hide in plain sight, I figured that I should do the next best thing and hide out of sight. Now, if I knew I was gonna have to lay low until everyone left, I would've cased out a place to park comfortably for a couple of hours. Since I didn't, I had to do like my man Vin Diesel and improvise.

I went about my business like I was leaving, and clocked out and headed to the door. At the last minute, I pretended like I was interested in looking at the computer display. In order to throw people off my trail, I told one of my coworkers that it looked like some kid was going to steal video games. He went off to tell security, and once the coast was clear, I ducked back by the TVs. Sure enough, there was plenty of room on the shelves behind the display models. I climbed up there and got myself situated.

It didn't look comfortable, but I was wiped. As soon as I was sure I was out of sight, I dozed off.

When I came to, everything was dark. Perfect. It worked just like I had planned. I just had to go down, find the video game chair, and finish the night. That's when I realized that my leg was asleep. Not just asleep, but pretty much dead. It must have been from lying on that tangle of cords. I tried to wiggle my toes, but it didn't seem to be working. All of a sudden, my leg spasmed, and I kicked one of the TVs off the shelf.

My first thought was that I could just pick it up in the morning, before anyone got there, and I could catch some more Z's in the meantime. That's when the alarm went off. I looked all around for another hiding spot, but there wasn't one I could get to with my leg all dead. Plus, I wasn't going to be able to sleep with that alarm going off. I hightailed it to the emergency exit, which set off another alarm. I wasn't about to try and make it to my car, because I could hear the cops coming, so I had to limp away as fast as I could to the parking lot of the mall across the way, where I could wait it out until the coast was clear.

I mostly got away with it, but the next Monday, my coworker Wayne told me that he knew that I was the guy who set off the alarm, since my car was still in the parking lot when he left that night. So now, to keep him quiet, I got to pick up a shift for him some time, only I got to punch in on his card so he still gets the money.

One of these days, I'm gonna put the hurt on that guy, but it's going to be served cold. If any of you got a lead on a job, that would be awesome. I can't live on mac and cheese much longer. Well, I could, but I'm getting real sick of it."""]),
    ('file:html/news/theonion/2.html', ["Hanna Montana's Secret Identity…Revealed!", """
Item! Have you ever noticed that you never see Miley Cyrus and Hanna Montana in the same room at the same time? (She's kind of like Superman and Peter Parker in that way.) Well, that's because the hot Disney singer and the hot teen singer are one and the same person! I hope I haven't put her father, country superstar Billy Ray Cyrus, in danger by revealing her secret identity, but it's news, and my job is to break big news.

Is it just me, or are there too many computer cartoons? Maybe my age is showing, but I'll take a good old-fashioned animated classic like Nimm's Secret over a dozen computer cartoons any day.

Item! One of the things that makes this country great is the way we choose our representatives, and we recently chose one of our most important representatives of all: Miss USA. It was nice to know that, in the midst of high gas prices and war and the subprime mortgage mess, we could come together as a nation and pick a young woman to stand for beauty and talent and womanhood for all America. And the winner this year, in a magical ceremony, was Miss Texas! As much as I like Donnie and Marie as hosts, I think that they made a mistake getting rid of Bert Parks. Now, there was a host! There was a voice! If they don't bring him back I'm not going to stop watching, but if someone could put a word in, that would be great.

Spring is in the air, so if you have bulbs that need planting, now is the time. What are you waiting for? Roll up those sleeves and get digging!

Item! Are they or aren't they? That question could apply to just about anyone or anything but, music fans, you know what I'm talking about! Rumor has it Bootylicious chanteuse Beyond and rap mogul Jay Zee tied the knot recently. Or did they? There's all sorts of conflicting stories behind these so-called nuptials, so I'll just put this out there: Jay, Beyond, you make a great couple, and you've been together for a while. So even if you didn't get married, you are married in my mind and in the minds of your fans. Why not just trot on down to city hall and get the paper?

Why do I know the name Kim Kardashian? I woke up in the middle of the night and it took me a few minutes before I realized that she was in a sex tape and is now on a reality show. But really, so what? She is just taking up the space in my brain that good, honest celebrities like Gabreille Carteris should hold. If it's that easy to get a reality show, I need to get an agent. But first, I need to get a good night's sleep.

Item! An anonymous New York businessman recently paid $1.5 million for a sex film of Marilyn Monroe. He says it will be kept private. All I can say is wow. No trashy sex tapes for Marilyn—no, she went for film. And it will be kept private. That's real class. You hear that, Miss Kardashian?

Item! I was walking down the street last week, when I started to get a powerful thirst for some peppermint tea (I cut out the coffee after noon as part of my new health regimen). I stopped by my favorite coffee shop and who should I spot but Ron Howard's brother! I have no idea what he was doing in my neck of the woods, but I decided I should just leave him alone. That didn't mean I couldn't watch him, though! Howard's brother seemed really down to earth. He ordered a latte, but he added his own sugar. Then he sat down and started reading The Cries Of 49 or something like that. I'll have to get that book and read it so I have an in next time I see him.

I just bought Bob & Doug McKenzie's album on CD the other day. And you know what? It still holds up. Take off, eh?

Item! It looks like the great lost cause of pop stardom Britney Spears is back on track. The head-shaving diva was recently in a car accident, but according to police on the scene, she passed the field sobriety test. You hear that, haters? There was no liquor involved. You go girl! We knew you could do it! You're only one step away from getting your kids back now. Let me know if you need a character witness.

A lot of people have wondered why I haven't weighed in on the Heath Leger tragedy yet. Well, you're just going to have to wonder a while longer.

Blind item! MTV gave a certain tubby gossip hack a series of one-hour specials about the goings-on of Hollywood. Hey, MTV, if you're so desperate to get commentary on the who, what, where, why, and when of celebrities that you'll hire any pathetic fatty who can bang on a keyboard and steal other people's pictures to post online, my number is in the book. And I don't work blue.

Well, that about wraps it up for this week's installment of "The Outside Scoop." I didn't get to everything I wanted to—like Jeff Bridge's parking problems or the identity of Hanna Montana—but that was only because of space. I meant to, honest! Hopefully, I'll put a little something in there about those jaw-droppers next time. But until then, the velvet rope is up, so I'll have to see you again…on the Outside! """]),
    ('file:html/news/theonion/3.html', ["Smoove Is Waiting", """
Girl, there comes a time when even a strong, well-dressed man must admit defeat.

It has been a long time since we broke up and you left me standing in the rain outside of your condo. As I walked home that evening, it never would have crossed my mind that four years from now you would not have returned to me, that you would have nearly gotten married, that you would not even receive one of my phone calls. Or my letters, text messages, faxes, or instant messages.

Four years ago this would have been inconceivable that you, my one true girl, could have stayed away from me for this long. Do you not remember how it once was? We were like two love prospectors who discovered richer and richer veins of pure ecstasy. We would bump and grind in the dimly lit tunnels as shining white donkeys would carry wagons of our love to be washed off and then smelted down into fine pieces of jewelry, which I would place on your naked chocolate body while you slept. When you awoke, we would freak again.

How could a love this sexy end? After many long nights in my round circular bed wondering, and long days looking at myself in my large oval mirror, I have come to the realization that we may never do the nasty again.

Damn.

I just wanted to use this opportunity to say that no matter what happens in my life or what happens I will be here, waiting for you. Even if I am married, living in the suburbs with three children, if you were to send me a note saying "Let's give it another chance" I would immediately abandon my life, rent out my old penthouse apartment, take my clothes out of storage, and immediately start creating a sumptuous dinner or breakfast for me to feed you, depending on the time of the day it was. That is what you mean to me.

I would, at this point, like to ask any women that I am currently dating to stop reading this column.

So, girl, if you doubt that I no longer love you, I ask you to remove that doubt, for this love is deep. Too deep to fade by the mere passage of time. If you worry about how you have treated me in the past, which, I think we both can admit, was cold, I would say that having you back in my arms was worth the pain and torment I have endured by your absence. If you worry that we will no longer be physically compatible, that somehow we will no longer be able to light the fuse of the atom bomb that is our sexuality, I have to say, you know that not to be true.

While a small sliver of hope will always remain inside of me, Smoove has come to the hard understanding that you are not coming back to me. It is like a part of Smoove has died and, for this part, he has begun to grieve. I am not certain of which stage of the mourning process it is that one begins making lists, but Smoove has begun making them. I now present to you Smoove's Happiest Memories Of When We Were Together:

#5: That time I broke you off nasty outside of that club.

#4: Making love until the dawn on Christmas morning.

#3: The night you invited your friend Cherise into our bedroom and I then hand-fed both of you the succulent berries before getting freaky with both of you in my whirlpool.

#2: The many nights you rode my pony until I couldn't take it anymore.

#1: Waking up before you, and just holding you in my arms until you woke up and then hitting you doggy-style until you lost your mind.

That is only one list of many. I have many complex emotions to work though. And while my hair remains impeccable and my clothes are fresh, the feelings that lie beneath Smoove's surface roil like a volcano waiting for you to calm the tempest by saying those three little words; "I need you." If you were to add the words "now" or "right here on the floor" I would have no problem with that.

Even if you are not interested in once again contacting Smoove, arranging a time to meet, getting picked up in fine white automobile, dancing all night at a popular nightspot, enjoying a late dinner before being loved so hard and long you will think your heart may explode from pure 100 percent uncut pleasure, I will accept this. It has taken Smoove a long time and many heart-to-heart talks with my main man, Darnell, but I have come to grips with the situation.

What Smoove would like you to understand is this: No matter where you are or who you are with, there is a man who smells of exotic lotions who loves you and wants you to be happy. And if you are ever need another taste, Smoove will always be here, ready to break you off some.

Smoove out."""]),
    ('file:html/news/theonion/4.html', ["Comedy Tonight!", """
I'm still not sure what possessed me to walk into Laughingstock's Comedy Club and sign up for their open-mic night. But I guess sometimes the less you think about doing something, the more apt you are to do it. For years I had dreamed about bringing my gift for comedy to the live stage. True, I might be more known for the written word, but I'm always coming up with funny things to say out loud. Yet I was way too shy to actually go through with it. Then one day I happened to be driving by the place. I pulled into the parking lot, walked in, and the rest is history. I don't know, maybe it was the big, inviting W.C. Fields stenciled on the front window, or the $8.99 all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp special, which you've got to admit is pretty cheap. Whichever, there was something right about it all.

Of course, try telling all that to Hubby Rick! Boy, I guess he must have permanently lent his sympathetic ear to his barfly buddies at Tacky's Tavern, because when it came to my decision he acted like he was stone deaf! You know what the first thing he asked me was? "Are you getting paid?" Sheesh, with him it's always about the do-re-mi! When I told him no, he scoffed. "I don't get out of bed for less than $9.50 an hour," Rick said. Then he said that hookers have more sense than I do, because they know not to give it away for free. Doesn't he know anything about the world of comedy? It's based entirely on love and truth. The money is secondary. (But like all good clowns, I decided to convert my hubby's grouchy ways into fodder for my act, as you shall see!)

As it turned out, open-mic night didn't take up the whole night; it actually was used as a warm-up thing for the two professional cutups who were performing. I spotted one of them at the bar eating popcorn shrimp—he looked just like the photo tacked up in the glass signboard out front, only a little older, and his hair was less gray. I don't remember his name (he was kind of tall and burly and wore a leather jacket—does that ring a bell for anyone?), but I was eager to say a few kind, encouraging words to the merry jester. I placed my hand on his. He looked a little surprised. I looked straight into his eyes and told him, "Thank you for being a clown. Thank you for making the world laugh and forget its troubles for a minute or two. You provide an invaluable service." Then I walked away. I felt any other words would kill the moment. I had shared something real. I'm sure he very much appreciated it, for as I understand it, clowns live for the attention.

I introduced myself to the club's MC, who took me to a little room where two other amateurs sat. One looked like he was no older than 13, and the other looked to be a college kid. I didn't really talk to them, though, because this was about the time I started to feel really, really nervous and sick to my stomach. Fortunately, I didn't have to go on straightaway, since the college kid went first. I started to gather my wits. That was a good thing, because I almost forgot to put on my funny costume I planned just for this event—a red clown nose, huge polka-dot necktie, and propeller beanie! I thought it was a funny little touch that heightened the spirit of fun.

Soon it was my turn. To hear my name called and the smattering of applause it received was both exhilarating and terrifying! I climbed onstage and was immediately hit with a blinding light pointing at the stage. How do the jokesters put up with that? I could hardly see the notes I wrote on my hand! It so unnerved me that for a few seconds I couldn't say anything into the mic. The silence roared in my ears.

After my eyes got a little more used to the light, I launched into an observational-humor joke. I talked about bottled water, and how it seemed weird to pay for something free. I thought it was pretty funny, but no one really laughed at it. Maybe it went over their heads a little. The younger people probably don't remember a time in which we only drank tap water.

Then I did my couch potatoes joke: "If two couch potatoes mate, does that make their offspring hash browns?" That didn't get too many laughs either. I don't get why not—that joke could be printed in a joke book; it's that solid. Undeterred, however, I launched into that hilarious evergreen, my Pet Rock joke. "I had to put my Pet Rock to sleep recently," I said. "I felt sad, but old Sedi—that's short for sedimentary—had a good run. It lived to 32!"

You could have heard a pin drop. Again, perhaps the reference was too old. So I decided to haul out the big guns and talk about Hubby Rick, because who can't relate to a louse of a spouse who can be a real pain in the patoot? "My hubby drinks so much that the state granted him his own liquor license!" I said. "When we first got married, he promised me a house, and he came through—we're now the proud owners of a Barbie Dream House. 'But you didn't specify the size!' he said."

"Show us your tits," a voice from the audience said.

A couple others immediately screamed "Noooo!" I raised my hands to silence them all. "I don't expect everyone to appreciate clean humor," I said. "Thanks for your time. Enjoy the rest of the show. Good night."

I left the stage. The MC looked a little startled—I guess he expected my act to last much longer. But I tell you, because I refused to stoop to demeaning behavior, I walked off that stage with my head held high (though it made my red nose fall off and I had to pick it up in front of everyone). I returned to the little room to pack my gear, and watched the third act, the 13-year-old, on the closed-circuit TV. He got some big laughs talking about school cafeteria food and mean gym teachers, even though in my view he wasn't any funnier than me. But no matter—my dream of being a clown had come true, and completely on my own terms!

But seriously, I think that Pet Rock joke was a pretty good one. I mean, rocks obviously don't die! Who saw that one coming? """]),

Where were you in July 17, 1981?

Like most Americans, I was standing in line for the premiere of the most awaited film event of the century: Arthur. Dudley Moore had just wowed the critics for his turn in the hit 10, and there was much speculation that this would be an even bigger hit. What an understatement!

Nobody, not even the studio that released Arthur, could've imagined the impact it would have on the world. It was just a simple love story about a drunk millionaire who falls for a poor girl and must choose between following his fortune or his heart. But, oh, the power of that story! Dudley Moore, Liza Minnelli and Sir John Gielgud became household names. Christopher Cross' theme song went platinum. And, of course, millions of people imitated Arthur every day by getting blitzed.

And where was I during all this hubbub? Why, waiting in line to see Arthur again, of course! I saw Arthur a grand total of 218 times in the theater and 735 times on video, and I read the novelization 416 times before the cover fell off and the binding turned to dust. I went to the Arthur conventions, dressed like Arthur for Halloween, and wrote a manual that includes schematics of all the rooms in Arthur's mansion (Attention publishers: The book still hasn't been optioned. Hint! Hint!) I even started my own fan club, King Arthur's Court. Our peak membership was seven Arthurians, but three of them have since died of liver cancer.

Yes, I'm quite proud to say that Arthur has been the guiding force in my life. Though I'm not much of a drinker, I gleaned as much from the film as possible and applied it to my daily life. I hired an acid-tongued butler named Hobson. I started shoplifting like Liza Minnelli's character, Linda. I even wore a top hat in the bathtub!

>Imagine my joy in 1988 when the long-awaited sequel, Arthur 2: On the Rocks, finally arrived. At long last, I could see more adventures of my favorite characters. There they were, Arthur and Linda, on screen together again, and they were married! Imagine my surprise when I learned they were trying to adopt a child, even though Arthur had lost his fortune. Even Hobson, who died in the original movie, came back as a ghost. I was in heaven! I saw Arthur 2: On the Rocks about 150 times, then I bought the video and watched it until it burned up in my VCR and, ultimately, reduced my apartment to cinders.

So now it's been more than eight years since Arthur 2, and I haven't heard boo about Arthur 3. Let's get cracking, Hollywood--the teeming masses are waiting!

The other Arthurians and I have done a lot of research, and we've uncovered some incredible facts. Did you know that Steve Gordon, the writer and director of the original Arthur, wrote three complete Arthur trilogies before he died? The one in which Arthur takes place is actually the second of the trilogies. The first covers the story of how Arthur's father acquired his fortune, and details his battles with opium addiction. In the third trilogy, Arthur's son returns to his grandfather's native country to become a fig farmer, only to come face to face with a rival Hobson's great-grandson! Word also has it that the only characters who will appear in all three trilogies are the Droids.

Much ink has been spilled about next year's theatrical re-release of Arthur. Apparently, Warner Brothers has uncovered some lost footage, and is re-incorporating it into the movie. The missing scenes include one in which Arthur drunkenly falls into a swimming pool at a fancy dinner party.

Warner Brothers also plans to replace all the old special effects with fancy new digital effects, claiming that Arthur will seem even more drunk than before. Well, I say, why fix what ain't broken?! Give us what we really want: the final installment of the trilogy! My fellow Arthurians and I may be a small group, but we're very vocal. We've petitioned Bud Yorkin, the director of Arthur 2, to break the silence on Arthur 3, but he won't return our calls. We've camped out in front of Dudley Moore's mansion and sung Arthur's Theme in all-night vigils, only to be manhandled by Dudley's thuggish security personnel. Even Liza Minnelli, who could use the kind of career boost Arthur 3 would give her, has refused to meet us at the front desk at the detox clinic.

But, by God, we won't give up! We've just got to know what happens next! Will Arthur be able to stay on the wagon long enough to see his son grow to be a man? Will Linda ever return to the stage to reprise her role in Cabaret? And will Arthur and Linda be able to get Hobson out of the carbon freeze? Dammit, Warner Brothers, we demand to know!

    ('file:html/news/bbc/1.html', ["US media ownership rules relaxed", """US regulators are to relax local media ownership rules preventing firms from controlling both a TV channel and a newspaper in its largest cities.

    The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to scrap a 32-year old rule preventing dual ownership of print and broadcast outlets in 20 cities.

    In a 3-2 split vote, Republican members said the move "struck a balance" between competition and plurality.

    But dissenting Democrats said it would create new loopholes, not close them.

    The Republican chairman of the FCC, Kevin Martin, cast the deciding vote.

    He called the move a "relatively minimal loosening of the ban", adding it "may help to forestall the erosion in local news coverage".

    Political issue

    The issue is politically contentious, with groups within both houses of Congress pressing the FCC to delay its judgement and threatening to pass legislation to revoke the decision.

    However, the White House has warned it will veto any bill coming out of Congress which waters down the proposed changes.

    The decision overturns rules in place since 1975 designed to support diversity of opinion and competition among news suppliers.

        
        The public has repeatedly told us they are not interested in further media consolidation
        Jonathan Adelstein, Democrat commissioner of the FCC

        Proponents of reform argued that the proliferation of cable TV channels and the growth of the internet meant such safeguards were now obsolete.

        But critics said that while the number of media outlets had exploded, the amount of different news providers had not risen.

        "The law says we are to serve the public interest," said Jonathan Adelstein, one of the two Democrat commissioners on the FCC panel.

        "And the public has repeatedly told us they are not interested in further media consolidation."

        The new rules will apply to the largest 20 local media markets in the country.

        For dual ownership of a newspaper and TV channel to be permitted under the new system, eight independently owned media businesses must exist in the market concerned, while the TV channel cannot be among the four most-watched.

    Lego instead said it expected to complete a deal by the end of summer.

    Lego has four Legoland themeparks: San Diego, California; Windsor in the UK; Guenzburg in Germany; and Billund, Denmark.

    Blackstone, the New York-based company said to be leading the race to buy the parks, has already expressed an interest in buying the Legoland sites.

    It has also only recently taken over the company which owns popular London tourist attraction London Dungeon.

    On Monday, 23 May, Blackstone announced that it had bought Merlin Entertainment for £102.5m. Merlin also owns 19 Sea Life centres across Europe.

    Back in April Lego announced that its annual net losses had more than doubled to 1.9bn Danish kroner ($328m; £174.9m) - only the fourth loss in the family-owned firm's 72-year history.

    In recent years, Lego has unsuccesfully tried to diversify away from its core building bricks.

    It invested heavily in a host of new markets, including computer games, baby products, camping goods and even shoes, few of which have performed to expectations.

    Four waiters argued two London restaurants had infringed their human rights by adding tips, left as part of cheque and credit card payments, to their wage packets as "additional pay".


    The only way to be sure the money goes to the waiter is to leave a cash tip

    Solicitor Catherine Scrivens

    But the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has upheld the decision by UK courts to reject the complaints - ending a 10-year legal battle.

    Unions and low pay campaigners have condemned the ruling.

    The Paradiso e Inferno, in The Strand, and the Trota Blu, in Leicester Square, did not infringe the waiters' human rights, the court ruled on Tuesday.

    One of the waiters Julio Rodriguez has died since the legal battle began.

    Damages rejected

    The four waiters - Italian Sandro Nerva and Spaniards Mr Rodriguez, Jose Pulleiro and Jose Gigirey-Cabo, sued for breach of contract over the additional pay being counted towards their wages.


    I believe the court has done an injustice not only to us but to all waiting staff

    Waiter Sandro Nerva

    Their claim for damages in the High Court on the basis they had received less than the minimum wage given to waiters was rejected in 1994.

    Tips paid by cheque or credit card belonged to the employer and could count towards payment of a minimum wage the court then ruled - a decision upheld by the Appeal Court.

    When the waiters were refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords they argued in Strasbourg that their rights to protection of property and against discrimination, under the European Convention on Human Rights, had been breached.

    Tuesday's judgment said the legal title to tips paid by customers using cheques or credit cards passed to the waiters' employers as vouchers were made out to them.

    Waiters received as "additional pay", what they would have received had the tips been paid in cash, minus tax and national insurance contributions.

    It held, by six votes to one, that there had been no breach of their rights to protection of property and unanimously that there had been no violation of their rights not to be discriminated against.

    Tips vital

    The waiters' solicitor Catherine Scrivens said waiters had been given protection under the wages councils for hotel and catering workers because they worked long hours for low pay.

    Waiters often work long hours
    "Customer tips are an important source of income," she said.

    "I am sure most customers believe that when they leave a credit card tip that it goes to the waiter.

    "The only way to be sure the money goes to the waiter is to leave a cash tip".

    She called for legislation compelling restaurants to state on menus whether credit card tips were passed on in full to waiters and waitresses.

    Richard Towers, director of the Low Pay Unit said: "People should have a decent living wage without having to rely on tips."

    A spokeswoman for the GMB union said: "Tips are a reward for good service, not an excuse for employers to renege on their responsibility to pay wages."

    Costly decision

    Waiter Mr Nerva said: "I believe the court has done an injustice not only to us but to all waiting staff," he said.

    The 64-year-old, of Pimilco, London, believed the policy had cost him £20,000 during his time working at the Paradiso e Inferno.

    But the restaurant manager, who declined to give his name, said he had thought the case had finished five years ago.

    "But I'm not surprised at the result, there's nothing wrong with what we are doing

    Thursday's stoppage - the sixth in the past three months - is the most serious yet in a dispute which German ministers have warned could do serious damage to its economy.

        Only half of normal regional services were running in the west of the country while in the east, this figure was down as low as 10%.

        Only a third of suburban trains were operating in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, and Stuttgart, while commuters in Berlin faced severe delays as only 20% of trains departed.

        Traffic on city centre roads quickly built up to much-higher than normal levels.

        But mainline inter-city services were less badly affected, with more than 70% of services running normally.

        'No surrender'

        In a series of newspaper advertisements, Deutsche Bahn called on GDL union officials to "stop this madness".

        "If we were to cave in now, the damage to the economy would ultimately be far greater," Deutsche Bahn executive Karl-Friedrich Rausch said.

        "They are trying to force us to an unconditional surrender. That is not going to happen."

        But union officials said management had failed to put forward an improved offer which could persuade them to return to the negotiating table.

        "The Bahn management board must once and for all stop provoking strikes," GDL chairman Manfred Schell said in a statement. "We want a negotiable offer."

        Train drivers are holding out for a much better deal than other Deutsche Bahn employees have received, arguing they merit a separate settlement on pay and working conditions.
