    ('file:html/news/theage/1.html', ["""PREMIER John Brumby has commissioned taxpayer-funded polling to gauge public reaction to the prospect of the Government building the contentious "missing link" in Melbourne's ring road.

Mr Brumby's department has engaged market research firm I-view to assess voters' views on a range of controversial projects he is considering for inclusion in a multibillion-dollar plan to tackle Melbourne's road and public transport congestion.

The telephone survey asks people their opinion on suggestions that the Metropolitan Ring Road be extended from Greensborough to the EastLink tollway at Ringwood, through some of the city's most environmentally sensitive areas.

The Opposition last night said the Government had been caught out secretly polling residents on a plan local Labor MPs claimed they opposed.

The Opposition's planning spokesman and member for the Northern Metropolitan Region, Matthew Guy, said building the ring road's missing link would require construction through one of Melbourne's "green wedges" and compulsory acquisition of homes in Diamond Creek, Warrandyte North and on the south side of the Yarra River.

"For years the Labor members for Yan Yean (Danielle Green) and Eltham (Steve Herbert) have claimed they are against building a ring road, but now we find their own party is in fact conducting research to ascertain whether the road has public support," Mr Guy said.

Government spokesman Ben Ruse last night said extending the ring road had not been ruled in or out. He said the Government was consulting widely on options for its transport statement, expected to be released in October or November.

Mr Brumby said last month that several groups had been lobbying the Government to include the "missing link" in the transport blueprint.

"But it's a very difficult issue because if you're to build that link it goes through some very sensitive areas of parkland," he said. "And you'd need to look at things like tunnels and so on to preserve the environment."

 he RACV, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Victorian Freight and Logistics Council are among influential lobby groups that hope Mr Brumby announces a plan to complete the ring road as part of his pre-Christmas transport statement.

The I-view survey is also asking people their views on the two main proposals in Sir Rod Eddington's report to the Government: an 18-kilometre road tunnel linking the Eastern Freeway with CityLink and the Ring Road; and a 17-kilometre rail tunnel from Footscray to Caulfield via the CBD and St Kilda Road."""]),

    - Costello leads poll
    - Nelson's rising disapproval
    - PM's approval falling

    Mr Costello has more than double Dr Nelson's 27% support in a head-to-head contest. In a three-way contest, Mr Costello - who has yet to declare his future - scores 44% to Malcolm Turnbull's 27% and Dr Nelson's 17%.

    The poll has mixed news for Mr Turnbull. In a straight contest with Mr Costello, he is badly behind (35%-49%). But in a head-to-head with Dr Nelson, he has an overwhelming lead (47%-31%).

    This would put Mr Turnbull in a good position if Mr Costello carried through his earlier indications that he will depart politics - but badly placed if the former treasurer changes his mind and stays.

    The latest support for Mr Costello comes as Dr Nelson's approval fell five points to 31%. His disapproval has risen seven point to 53% in the national poll of 1400 people taken between Thursday and Saturday.

    This is the first time a majority of voters has disapproved of him as Opposition Leader. Since the last poll, Dr Nelson had a major setback when he was forced to retreat, amid bad publicity, from his push to toughen the Opposition's climate change policy.

    Kevin Rudd leads Dr Nelson as preferred prime minister, 65% (steady) to 19% (down one). But Mr Rudd's approval has fallen six points to 60% - his lowest rating as Prime Minister although still very high. His disapproval has risen four points to 31%.

    The past month has seen no significant change in voting intentions, with Labor's two-party vote up just one point to 55% and the Coalition down one to 45%. Labor's primary vote is steady on 43%; the Coalition is down one point to 39%. The Government's two-party support is still above what it polled at the November election. Continued...

    ('file:html/news/theage/3.html', ["""A MELBOURNE engineer is working on a computer program that can diagnose depressed teenagers simply by analysing their voice.

    The world-first research, by RMIT senior lecturer Margaret Lech, could transform psychiatry, which lacks an objective test for this illness. It could even be used as a screening test in high schools or when someone phones a health provider.

    "We want to develop an objective system that could be applied by people with no clinical knowledge about depression," Dr Lech said.

    "The latest research shows that depression starts at an early age, so if it's detected it will help a teenager understand their behaviour and learn how to deal with it."

    Dr Lech said her research was inspired by a Stephen Fry documentary about his manic depression and a TV interview with former premier and beyondblue chairman Jeff Kennett. She asked herself how she could help with the growing problem of youth depression, and realised her work in speech analysis at RMIT's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering might provide insights.

    She contacted Associate Professor Nicholas Allen from the ORYGEN Research Centre and the department of psychology at the University of Melbourne. Professor Allen had compiled video and audio recordings of more than 300 adolescents at various stages of depression.

    Dr Lech's computer program is scanning through the voice data, using pattern recognition techniques to seek telltale "harmonics" unique to a depressed person's voice. It can detect harmonics related to seven different emotions, including fear, excitement or anxiety.

    The theory is that those emotions are expressed in a different way in the voice of a depressed teenager. The program is able to tell the difference between the voices of a group of people suffering from depression from a non-depressed group Â— though it is not yet developed enough to diagnose an individual with sufficient certainty.

    Professor Allen said the research was at an early stage but showed great promise. "In clinical work, the voice is often one of the first things you notice (in depressed patients)," he said.

    "I can tell with my patients on the phone, sometimes after only a few words, how they are going. You can hear a flatness, a tension coming through. The voice changes very dramatically when they are depressed.

    "It is a logical target for a diagnostic tool. We are a long way away from having something that's clinically useful, though."

    He speculated that it could be used in mass screening, to flag "at risk" people for a more exhaustive assessment.

    The researchers are announcing the study to coincide with National Science Week, which runs until next Sunday.

    It could lead to an upbeat spring auction season, with buyers more willing to purchase a home if they believe the current cycle of tighter interest rates is over.
    
    Figures collected from across the metropolitan area showed clearance rates for weekend auctions rose strongly to 66%, up from 60% last weekend.
    
    It was the biggest gain in week-on-week growth for a non-holiday auction period in a year, although the clearance rate is still well below rates close to 85% reached last year.
    
    The highest weekend clearance rate was recorded for house auctions in the north-east (88%), and sales activity in the inner city was also strong, according to the Real Estate Institute of Victoria.
    
    "Buyers reacted positively to speculation about a drop in interest rates by the Reserve Bank, leading to an improvement in the clearance rate," REIV chief executive Enzo Raimondo said.
    
    Agents working at the weekend at auctions and open-for-inspections reported there was more interest from buyers. However, they said home buyers would need to see a number of rate cuts before they rushed back into the market.
    
    Peter Bennison, a director at JP Dixon Real Estate, said bidding was not fierce at the auctions he attended in the inner east, but properties were selling rather than being passed in.
    
    "People are starting to think about property again," Mr Bennison said. "They may not be out there bidding strongly yet, but they are starting to think this is the end."
    
    Craig Stephens, director of sales at Jas H Stephens, said: "Buyers and sellers still seem to be sitting on the fence a bit. It seems to be a given that the RBA will reduce rates next month, but the big question on everyone's lips is 'will the banks pass on the full rate cut?'

    The drug's potential is so great it could mark an end to dialysis for patients with kidney disease and reduce the need for organ transplants.
    
    Scientists from the University of Melbourne, St Vincent's Hospital and Bio21 Institute say the breakthrough could rival Ian Frazer's cervical cancer vaccine in putting Australia on the world map of medical discoveries.
    
    The drug works by preventing the spread of fibrosis - the irreversible scarring of vital organs that underpins many major killers such as kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes and lung and liver problems. As fibrosis advances, it causes such extensive damage that the organ shuts down, eventually resulting in death.
    
    There is no available treatment that prevents or halts the spread of the condition and scientists internationally are racing to be the first to produce an antifibrotic drug.
    
    The Melbourne discovery, named FT-11, has created such international excitement that the US Government has pledged up to $3 million to accelerate the drug to market - the first time such a grant has been awarded in Australia.
    
    The Melbourne project has had a 100% success rate in trials on rats and will be trialled on about 30 Victorian patients within months.

    Scientists estimate the drug's worldwide market would be worth up to $2 billion in the first year alone. It would also be a financial coup worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Melbourne University because it shares patent rights for the drug through Fibrotech Therapeutics.
    
    Associate Professor Darren Kelly, who led the two-year quest to develop the drug, said: "This is the first drug of its kind in the world and the implications are enormous. If this comes to fruition, and we're confident with the results so far â€¦ it would be up there with the cervical cancer vaccine (Gardasil), even bigger. It would be the biggest blockbuster since blood- pressure-lowering drugs." """]),

    The research shows that Victorians' support for legal late-term abortions after 24 weeks' gestation is much wider than reflected in a proposed law expected to go to state cabinet today.
    
    The Age believes the Government has settled on the Victorian Law Reform Commission's Option B, which makes abortion before 24 weeks the choice of the mother, but strictly prescribes when an abortion can be provided after that date.
    
    But a Victorian obstetrician, associate professor Lachlan de Crespigny of the University of Melbourne, commissioned a survey that suggests the average Victorian favours a less restrictive law. The online survey of 1050 Australians (including 526 Victorians), by Crosby/Textor, evaluated support for legal abortion after the 24-week cut-off. This was strongest for legal late abortions when continuing the pregnancy would put the life of the mother at risk, or when the baby had severe abnormalities that would lead to a short life.
    
    There was also majority support for decriminalising late abortions when: the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest, the baby might be physically or mentally impaired, the mother had a major drug addiction, or she was aged 15 or under.
    
    One-third of Victorians believed a late abortion should be allowed when the woman for any reason decided she did not wish to have the child, the woman or family could not afford to raise the child, or if the woman's partner died or left her during pregnancy.
    
    There were no circumstances in which a majority of Victorians, or Australians, believed a doctor should face sanctions for performing a termination after 24 weeks.

Five visits to Mount Hotham involved expenses totalling more than $8500.

But in many of the cases the assets, including more than 60 houses and 30 cars, were held in the names of other people. This resulted in a series of cases in which the seizure orders were listed to be contested in the County Court by those who claimed they, not Mokbel, were the true owners.

His lawyers agreed that their client was prepared to make a substantial cash payment to the Crown to square the ledger over a Mokbel property listed in the man's name.

    when I open mutt and want to write an email - it says that email has been sent but then when I want to check it on my other email account nothing has been delivered.

    can you give me any hint. I'm working with mutt, fetchmail for the first time.

    thanks
    """,
    """Well, that's because you maybe just configured GETTING your mail, but not SENDING your mail?

    POP and fetchmail are about getting your mail from your POP/IMAP-account.

    Mutt is just your tool to compose the mail (your mail user agent) - now you need something to get it out there.

    In your case of using gmail it possibly involves relaying over gmail - which is possible.

    I use msmtp to send mail out after composing it in mutt. Msmtp is small and very simple - I don't need an entire sendmail on my notebook just to send out 50 mails a day.

    From within mutt, this would be something like this in your muttrc:

    set sendmail="/usr/local/bin/msmtp"

    And my msmtprc says for gmail-relaying something like this:

    account default
    host smtp.gmail.com
    port 587
    user YOU@gmail.com
    password PASSWORD
    protocol smtp
    tls_starttls on
