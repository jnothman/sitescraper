    ('file:html/news/theage/1.html', ["""PREMIER John Brumby has commissioned taxpayer-funded polling to gauge public reaction to the prospect of the Government building the contentious "missing link" in Melbourne's ring road.

Mr Brumby's department has engaged market research firm I-view to assess voters' views on a range of controversial projects he is considering for inclusion in a multibillion-dollar plan to tackle Melbourne's road and public transport congestion.

The telephone survey asks people their opinion on suggestions that the Metropolitan Ring Road be extended from Greensborough to the EastLink tollway at Ringwood, through some of the city's most environmentally sensitive areas.

The Opposition last night said the Government had been caught out secretly polling residents on a plan local Labor MPs claimed they opposed.

The Opposition's planning spokesman and member for the Northern Metropolitan Region, Matthew Guy, said building the ring road's missing link would require construction through one of Melbourne's "green wedges" and compulsory acquisition of homes in Diamond Creek, Warrandyte North and on the south side of the Yarra River.

"For years the Labor members for Yan Yean (Danielle Green) and Eltham (Steve Herbert) have claimed they are against building a ring road, but now we find their own party is in fact conducting research to ascertain whether the road has public support," Mr Guy said.

Government spokesman Ben Ruse last night said extending the ring road had not been ruled in or out. He said the Government was consulting widely on options for its transport statement, expected to be released in October or November.

Mr Brumby said last month that several groups had been lobbying the Government to include the "missing link" in the transport blueprint.

"But it's a very difficult issue because if you're to build that link it goes through some very sensitive areas of parkland," he said. "And you'd need to look at things like tunnels and so on to preserve the environment."

 he RACV, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Victorian Freight and Logistics Council are among influential lobby groups that hope Mr Brumby announces a plan to complete the ring road as part of his pre-Christmas transport statement.

The I-view survey is also asking people their views on the two main proposals in Sir Rod Eddington's report to the Government: an 18-kilometre road tunnel linking the Eastern Freeway with CityLink and the Ring Road; and a 17-kilometre rail tunnel from Footscray to Caulfield via the CBD and St Kilda Road."""]),

    - Costello leads poll
    - Nelson's rising disapproval
    - PM's approval falling

    Mr Costello has more than double Dr Nelson's 27% support in a head-to-head contest. In a three-way contest, Mr Costello - who has yet to declare his future - scores 44% to Malcolm Turnbull's 27% and Dr Nelson's 17%.

    The poll has mixed news for Mr Turnbull. In a straight contest with Mr Costello, he is badly behind (35%-49%). But in a head-to-head with Dr Nelson, he has an overwhelming lead (47%-31%).

    This would put Mr Turnbull in a good position if Mr Costello carried through his earlier indications that he will depart politics - but badly placed if the former treasurer changes his mind and stays.

    The latest support for Mr Costello comes as Dr Nelson's approval fell five points to 31%. His disapproval has risen seven point to 53% in the national poll of 1400 people taken between Thursday and Saturday.

    This is the first time a majority of voters has disapproved of him as Opposition Leader. Since the last poll, Dr Nelson had a major setback when he was forced to retreat, amid bad publicity, from his push to toughen the Opposition's climate change policy.

    Kevin Rudd leads Dr Nelson as preferred prime minister, 65% (steady) to 19% (down one). But Mr Rudd's approval has fallen six points to 60% - his lowest rating as Prime Minister although still very high. His disapproval has risen four points to 31%.

    The past month has seen no significant change in voting intentions, with Labor's two-party vote up just one point to 55% and the Coalition down one to 45%. Labor's primary vote is steady on 43%; the Coalition is down one point to 39%. The Government's two-party support is still above what it polled at the November election. Continued...

    ('file:html/news/theage/3.html', ["""A MELBOURNE engineer is working on a computer program that can diagnose depressed teenagers simply by analysing their voice.

    The world-first research, by RMIT senior lecturer Margaret Lech, could transform psychiatry, which lacks an objective test for this illness. It could even be used as a screening test in high schools or when someone phones a health provider.

    "We want to develop an objective system that could be applied by people with no clinical knowledge about depression," Dr Lech said.

    "The latest research shows that depression starts at an early age, so if it's detected it will help a teenager understand their behaviour and learn how to deal with it."

    Dr Lech said her research was inspired by a Stephen Fry documentary about his manic depression and a TV interview with former premier and beyondblue chairman Jeff Kennett. She asked herself how she could help with the growing problem of youth depression, and realised her work in speech analysis at RMIT's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering might provide insights.

    She contacted Associate Professor Nicholas Allen from the ORYGEN Research Centre and the department of psychology at the University of Melbourne. Professor Allen had compiled video and audio recordings of more than 300 adolescents at various stages of depression.

    Dr Lech's computer program is scanning through the voice data, using pattern recognition techniques to seek telltale "harmonics" unique to a depressed person's voice. It can detect harmonics related to seven different emotions, including fear, excitement or anxiety.

    The theory is that those emotions are expressed in a different way in the voice of a depressed teenager. The program is able to tell the difference between the voices of a group of people suffering from depression from a non-depressed group  though it is not yet developed enough to diagnose an individual with sufficient certainty.

    Professor Allen said the research was at an early stage but showed great promise. "In clinical work, the voice is often one of the first things you notice (in depressed patients)," he said.

    "I can tell with my patients on the phone, sometimes after only a few words, how they are going. You can hear a flatness, a tension coming through. The voice changes very dramatically when they are depressed.

    "It is a logical target for a diagnostic tool. We are a long way away from having something that's clinically useful, though."

    He speculated that it could be used in mass screening, to flag "at risk" people for a more exhaustive assessment.

    The researchers are announcing the study to coincide with National Science Week, which runs until next Sunday.

    It could lead to an upbeat spring auction season, with buyers more willing to purchase a home if they believe the current cycle of tighter interest rates is over.
    
    Figures collected from across the metropolitan area showed clearance rates for weekend auctions rose strongly to 66%, up from 60% last weekend.
    
    It was the biggest gain in week-on-week growth for a non-holiday auction period in a year, although the clearance rate is still well below rates close to 85% reached last year.
    
    The highest weekend clearance rate was recorded for house auctions in the north-east (88%), and sales activity in the inner city was also strong, according to the Real Estate Institute of Victoria.
    
    "Buyers reacted positively to speculation about a drop in interest rates by the Reserve Bank, leading to an improvement in the clearance rate," REIV chief executive Enzo Raimondo said.
    
    Agents working at the weekend at auctions and open-for-inspections reported there was more interest from buyers. However, they said home buyers would need to see a number of rate cuts before they rushed back into the market.
    
    Peter Bennison, a director at JP Dixon Real Estate, said bidding was not fierce at the auctions he attended in the inner east, but properties were selling rather than being passed in.
    
    "People are starting to think about property again," Mr Bennison said. "They may not be out there bidding strongly yet, but they are starting to think this is the end."
    
    Craig Stephens, director of sales at Jas H Stephens, said: "Buyers and sellers still seem to be sitting on the fence a bit. It seems to be a given that the RBA will reduce rates next month, but the big question on everyone's lips is 'will the banks pass on the full rate cut?'

    The drug's potential is so great it could mark an end to dialysis for patients with kidney disease and reduce the need for organ transplants.
    
    Scientists from the University of Melbourne, St Vincent's Hospital and Bio21 Institute say the breakthrough could rival Ian Frazer's cervical cancer vaccine in putting Australia on the world map of medical discoveries.
    
    The drug works by preventing the spread of fibrosis - the irreversible scarring of vital organs that underpins many major killers such as kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes and lung and liver problems. As fibrosis advances, it causes such extensive damage that the organ shuts down, eventually resulting in death.
    
    There is no available treatment that prevents or halts the spread of the condition and scientists internationally are racing to be the first to produce an antifibrotic drug.
    
    The Melbourne discovery, named FT-11, has created such international excitement that the US Government has pledged up to $3 million to accelerate the drug to market - the first time such a grant has been awarded in Australia.
    
    The Melbourne project has had a 100% success rate in trials on rats and will be trialled on about 30 Victorian patients within months.

    Scientists estimate the drug's worldwide market would be worth up to $2 billion in the first year alone. It would also be a financial coup worth hundreds of millions of dollars for Melbourne University because it shares patent rights for the drug through Fibrotech Therapeutics.
    
    Associate Professor Darren Kelly, who led the two-year quest to develop the drug, said: "This is the first drug of its kind in the world and the implications are enormous. If this comes to fruition, and we're confident with the results so far … it would be up there with the cervical cancer vaccine (Gardasil), even bigger. It would be the biggest blockbuster since blood- pressure-lowering drugs." """]),

    The research shows that Victorians' support for legal late-term abortions after 24 weeks' gestation is much wider than reflected in a proposed law expected to go to state cabinet today.
    
    The Age believes the Government has settled on the Victorian Law Reform Commission's Option B, which makes abortion before 24 weeks the choice of the mother, but strictly prescribes when an abortion can be provided after that date.
    
    But a Victorian obstetrician, associate professor Lachlan de Crespigny of the University of Melbourne, commissioned a survey that suggests the average Victorian favours a less restrictive law. The online survey of 1050 Australians (including 526 Victorians), by Crosby/Textor, evaluated support for legal abortion after the 24-week cut-off. This was strongest for legal late abortions when continuing the pregnancy would put the life of the mother at risk, or when the baby had severe abnormalities that would lead to a short life.
    
    There was also majority support for decriminalising late abortions when: the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest, the baby might be physically or mentally impaired, the mother had a major drug addiction, or she was aged 15 or under.
    
    One-third of Victorians believed a late abortion should be allowed when the woman for any reason decided she did not wish to have the child, the woman or family could not afford to raise the child, or if the woman's partner died or left her during pregnancy.
    
    There were no circumstances in which a majority of Victorians, or Australians, believed a doctor should face sanctions for performing a termination after 24 weeks.

But in many of the cases the assets, including more than 60 houses and 30 cars, were held in the names of other people. This resulted in a series of cases in which the seizure orders were listed to be contested in the County Court by those who claimed they, not Mokbel, were the true owners.

His lawyers agreed that their client was prepared to make a substantial cash payment to the Crown to square the ledger over a Mokbel property listed in the man's name.

    Mr Taylor, who now lives in Adelaide, spent another 11 years in the navy after the accident, then worked in various jobs before being granted a disability pension.
    
    He has claimed damages for conditions including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, brain damage and stress conditions resulting in alcohol and cigarette addiction.
    
    Today, he said he wanted to take a holiday to Darwin, which he had not visited since before Cyclone Tracy struck in 1974. He also hoped to perform some charity work.
    
    Mr Taylor's solicitor, David Forster, from Hollows Lawyers, said he welcomed the Commonwealth's change of attitude under the new federal government. He said lawyers for the claimants hoped to lay the long-running Voyager saga to rest during the mediations over the next two weeks."""]),

In fact, some other users report success with this addon on 2.0.0.x, whilst for me just no version of this addon works, not even those ones designed for firefox 2.0.x.

If it is installed in your home folder check to see if the permissions permit you to run it. Keep in mind that Java scripts do not need execute permission to run. Also, if your /home is mounted on a separate partition you may have mounted it with the noexec mount parameter. Again, this will not disable a Java Script application but it would disable a binary application.

As of now, I have a standalone system (with Opensuse 10.3 - or SLES 10)

I need for the hostname of the system not to be associated with 127.0.0.1 (and the domain ~not~ to be associated with 127.0.0.2).

I think that hosts can be associated with IP addresses like 192.x.x.x but it seems to require that one be attached to the network or have some kind of access to a gateway - right?

Well, currently, I don't have that but I still need to fix the IP address.

Is there a way to use Yast, Yast2 or some other kind of networking so that the local host ip is other than 127.0.0.1?

TIA""",
"""why ?
All unix based machines i.e. linux have localhost set as 127.0.0.1 and lots of applications use that information in the background.
If your machine is on a network, your own or the internet then it will have another IP address.
Code:

ifconfig -a

will show what network interfaces are available including local loopback bound to 127.0.0.1
if there is anything else there then you can run
Code:

route

to see how they are used.
if you have a private IP address 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x then you should be able to set the IP address
Code:

man ifconfig

if your IP address is something else then it is being set by your network provider and you should speak to them.
If you want to spoof an IP address then remember that none of the packets from your target machine will ever get back to you.

let us know how you get on.

Thanks for responding

Basically, the software I am using requires that the hostname not be associated with 127.0.0.1 and that the domain not be associated with 127.0.0.2 - why they made it that way, I have no idea.

Is there a list of steps one can go through to do this?

"""Hello.

I'm trying to make pressure control work in gimp-2.4.7 on G-Pen 450 graphic tablet, on slackware 12.1.

Problem:
1) If in Edit->preferences->Input Devices->configure advanced input devices, tablet device mode is set to "disabled", pressure control doesn't work and I can draw only lines with constant thickness/opacity/etc. (as with mouse)
2) If in Edit->preferences->Input Devices->configure advanced input devices, tablet device mode is set to "Screen" or "Window", pressure control doesn't work, because when I press pen, pen cursor stops moving (i.e. freezes) until I stop pressing it. I.e. I can place "dots" by pen, but can't draw lines.

Additional info:
1) Pressure controls work fine in inkscape (version 0.46) or krita (from KDE 3.5.7). Krita detects presure automatically (because device is named as "stylus"), inkscape can use it, when in file->input devices device mode is set to "screen" or "window". However when I'm trying to use similar settings for tablet in gimp, cursor simply freezes when I try to draw something.
2) gimp 2.4.7 is built from source. In the gimp-2.4.5 (bundled with slackware 12.1) pressure controls didn't work either.
3) I'm using wizardpen 0.6.0.2 driver.
4) I've been using this and this HOWTOs to setup tablet. Unfortunately, HOWTOs has gimp-related content removed, and FAQ on gimp site doesn't seem to mention anything related to my problem.
5) Xorg.conf sections related to tablet(not sure if it's relevant to problem, because pressure control work in krita/inkscape):

I think that it must be caused by some config file having been changed in the update, but I looked at all of the files that the backup included with it, and thought I am not familiar with the config files for Daisy, I didn't see anything that looked wrong.""",

"""I'm not sure why you put the files in /root/Desktop, I think this will restrict the use to root only due to root ownership of that directory.

I installed ( as root ) to /usr/lib/firefox. I still have a /usr/lib/firefox2.0.0.16 directory with that version in it.

I created a desktop icon, and pointed it to the correct path and executable. I also set a working directory. Works like a charm, I still have the old version installed.

I suspect the command you used returns errors because of the place and path specified. My icon calls firefox with the command '/usr/lib/firefox/firefox'

You do not have to install to /usr/lib if you don't want to, there are other places you can put it. I would stay away from the /root dir though...""",

"""Well, I solved the problem- just another one of those stupid mistakes that are so easy to overlook. It turns out that when I set up mySQL I entered the skip-networking command in the config file to make it stop giving me that annoying socket error. That was all well and good, but it was preventing the SQL server from working properly. Now I have fixed that and have run into a new problem- I have fully installed Daisy, and it worked fine. The problem is that I am trying to restore from a backup made on a different system, so I am concerned that the config files might not match. I have fully restored, but I cannot get a connection to the repository server- any advice?""",

"""Hello all,

I have the following in my system:

- cat /etc/resolv.conf
search site
simba: kdcadm

- ifconfig
lo Link encap Loopback
inet address 127.0.0.1 Mask: 255.0.0.0
inet 6 addr :: 1/128 Scope: Host
UP LOOPBACK RUNNING MTU: 16436

- iwconfig
lo no wireless connections

- route (I get the following)
Destination: loopback
Gateway : *
Genmask : 255.0.0.0
Flags : U
Metric : 0
Ref : 0
Use : 0
Iface : lo

I need to be able to configure the host so that it is ~not~ using 127.0.0.1 but 192.168.x.x. I need the host of "simba" to be associated with 192.168.x.x and not 127.0.0.1

There is an ethernet interface but it is not showing up in any of the lists above.

I did the following:
_______________________________________
Yast -> Network Devices -> Network Card
- select ifup

I would click on a card except it just displays a message in the listing saying the card has not been configured. The buttons are "ghosted" so you cannot save anything
_______________________________________

I also changed the /etc/hosts file so that you would get:
_______________________________________

192.168.1.2 simba.pridelands simba
________________________________________

But pinging "simba" does not work, it just times out. When I set it back to :

_______________________________________

127.0.0.2 simba.pridelands simba
________________________________________

Then everything works again ...

Can someone **please** provide detailed steps on how to change my /etc/hosts file so that "simba" has an IP address of 192.168.x.x?

The system is not connected to the network.

TIA""",
